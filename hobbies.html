    <h2>Passions That Keep Me Inspired</h2>
    <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy activities that strengthen my creativity and reasoning.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Watching Mystery Movies:</strong> I enjoy analyzing mystery films that highlight how the same situation can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, helping me appreciate diverse viewpoints and think more analytically.</li>
      <li><strong>Playing Card Games:</strong> I enjoy strategic card games that require focus, planning, and adaptability, helping me strengthen my decision-making and problem-solving skills in dynamic situations.</li>
      <li><strong>Enjoying My Work:</strong> I believe that more we enjoy our work, the closer we get to perfection. And the more perfection we achieve in our work, the stronger our desire becomes to keep improving it.</li>
    </ul>
