    <h2>Some Academic Projects</h2>
    <p>Below are several academic projects that demonstrate my learning and problem-solving approach in Computer Science. Each project includes the course code and name, the term during which it was completed, a brief description, and a link to its GitHub repository.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stack Implementation</strong></li>
      <p><b>Course Code & Name:</b> COIS 2020H - Data Structures & Algorithms I (Winter 2025)</p>
      <p>This project showcases a fundamental implementation of a Stack data structure in C#, built entirely from memory during a closed-book test at Trent University.</p>
      <p>Using a linked list, it supports core stack operations—push, pop, isEmpty, and display—through a menu-driven interface. Developed in Visual Studio Code, the project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming, algorithmic logic, and error handling, while reinforcing key data structure concepts under time constraints.</p>

      <li><strong>Accessible Web Components</strong></li>
      <p><b>Course Code & Name:</b> COIS 2430H - Web Development I: Front-end (Winter 2025)</p>
      <p>This project demonstrates the development of accessible and responsive web components using HTML5 and CSS3, built as a coursework project at Trent University.</p>
      <p>It includes semantic layouts, accessible navigation, and properly structured tables and forms. Designed and tested in Visual Studio Code, it emphasizes usability, readability, and clean visual hierarchy while following WCAG accessibility principles, reflecting strong understanding of inclusive and structured web design.</p>

      <li><strong>Word Scramble</strong></li>
      <p><b>Course Code & Name:</b> COIS 3430H - Web Development II: Server-side (Summer 2025)</p>
      <p>This project showcases backend web development using PHP and MySQL, built as part of coursework at Trent University.</p>
      <p>It features a session-based word scramble game with a dynamic leaderboard and persistent score storage. The project demonstrates skills in form handling, string and array manipulation, session management, and database integration. It highlights the ability to develop interactive, data-driven web applications while maintaining semantic HTML, accessibility, and clean, maintainable code.</p>

      <li><strong>Movie Streaming App</strong></li>
      <p><b>Course Code & Name:</b> COIS 3430H - Web Development II: Server-side (Summer 2025)</p>
      <p>This full-stack web application, developed as part of coursework at Trent University, enables users to manage and review movies through personalized watchlists.</p>
      <p>Built with PHP, MySQL, React, and TypeScript, it features secure authentication, RESTful APIs, and a responsive frontend. The project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack development, including backend routing, database integration, state management, and API communication, while ensuring accessibility, usability, and modern design practices across both the server and client sides.</p>

      <li><strong>Graph Implementation</strong></li>
      <p><b>Course Code & Name:</b> COIS 3020H - Data Structures and Algorithms II (Fall 2025)</p>
      <p>This project models a weighted directed graph to calculate the shortest path between two locations, developed as part of coursework at Trent University.</p>
      <p>Built in C#, it uses adjacency lists for efficient graph representation, reads data from a JSON file, and applies Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path computation. The project demonstrates skills in algorithm design, data structure implementation, file parsing, and error handling within a practical route optimization context.</p>
