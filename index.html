            <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting! I’m <strong>Nitya Shah</strong>, a Computer Science student with a deep interest
                in understanding how technology shapes the world around us.
                I’m someone who enjoys solving problems, exploring new tools, and learning from every project or
                experience I take on.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Computer Science student, I’m building strong foundations across data, software, and design, while
                actively exploring the many directions this field offers.
                I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world environments, where I can both contribute to meaningful
                projects and discover where my strengths create the most impact.
                My focus right now is on continuous learning, problem-solving, and adaptability, the qualities I believe will
                allow me to grow quickly and add value to any team.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a space where I share my projects, academic experiences, skills, and personal
                reflections.
                Feel free to explore the links above to know more about me and my ongoing learning journey.
