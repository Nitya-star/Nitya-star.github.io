            <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting! I’m <strong>Nitya Shah</strong>, a Computer Science student with a deep interest
                in understanding how technology shapes the world around us.
                I’m someone who enjoys solving problems, exploring new tools, and learning from every project or
                experience I take on.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this stage of my journey, I’m still exploring the many directions within computer science including data
                and software to innovation and design.
                I believe that once I begin working in real-world environments, I’ll discover where my true interests
                and strengths align.
                For now, I focus on building strong fundamentals, trying new things, and enjoying the process of
                continuous learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a space where I share my projects, academic experiences, skills, and personal
                reflections.
                Feel free to explore the links above to know more about me and my ongoing learning journey.
